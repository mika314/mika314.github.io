# Hi!

![Mika](/imgs/mika.png)

This is my personal website I am setting it up right now. I have gotten the
awesome domain name and decided to host it on github, will see how it'll turned
out. I am quite happy with the domain name, it is mika.global. I think
that's awesome. IP addresses are not propagated yet :( The hoster said
it might take about 12 hours. Hopefully this will work. 

The goal of all this thing be happy and have fun. Also I'll try to
have fun for people around me. Will see.

That's it for now.

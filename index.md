# Hi! This is Mika.

This is my personal website I am setting up right now. I have get the domain name and decided to host it on github, will see how it turned out. I am quite happy with the domain name: mika.global, I think this is awesome. IP addresses are not propogated yet :(, it the hoster said it might take about 12 hours. Hopefully this will work.

The goal of all this thing be happy and have fun. Also I'll try to have fun for people around me. Will see.

That is it for now.

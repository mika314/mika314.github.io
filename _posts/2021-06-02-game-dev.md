# Clatter quest

* clatter component
* remove clatter on interaction
* update quest stat
* jump and interact
* subscription to interact

Working on the clatter quest. The hero cannot get out from the
apartment because the entrance to the apartment is
clattered. Everybody can levitate people started using windows instead
of doors.

I implemented some initial clatter disappearance animation. It flies
in the spiral and after two seconds getting destroyed.

I added jump and triggering interaction on left mouse click.

So for the quest system I have an idea on every significant event
generate the signal. And make quests to subscribe to this signal. In
the clatter quest I made an interact signal and implemented
subscription. In the quest player has to collect 5/5 clattered items.

TODO: Remove the barrier after player collected 5 clattered
items; drop some loot.

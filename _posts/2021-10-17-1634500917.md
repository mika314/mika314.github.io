During the travel to Albany and back I had to have to wear the mask. I
realized I kind of liked it. First nobody can see my face, and I do
not need to put any effort to hide my emotions, second something
always hugging my face and it is comforting, third I can touch my
face, back in a days I had really bad akcnies and the first thing I
have to learn: don't touch your face it will make it worse, and now my
face is protected with the mask.

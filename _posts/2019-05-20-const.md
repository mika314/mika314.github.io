Last year around December I posted a bug on SDL2. Here is the 
link: https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4421 . The request
was simple: SDL_Texture should be passed as a const pointer. And
example was:
```C++
int SDL_RenderCopy(SDL_Renderer*   renderer,
                   const SDL_Texture* texture,
                   const SDL_Rect* srcrect,
                   const SDL_Rect* dstrect);
```

In SDL2 API texture is passed to the function without const. So my bug was closed as
invalid. We had some back and forth, read the conversation in the
link. Your thoughts?

Lately while I am doing some randome thinkgs (playing games usualy) I
am thinking: "What am I doing?" Um... actually I do not think like
this anymore. I just play. So I was playing Minecraft three days in the
raw - at night - until 2am. Yeah...

I did not build too match. Just house. Mostly wondering in the caves
and mining iron and coal and listening Late Night Jazz on Spotify.

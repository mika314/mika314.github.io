I really do not know what to do with my life. Lately I have got sick,
first my little doughier have got sick, she has got an ear infection. I
was coughing and was kind of tired, now cough is gone, but I am always
sleepy, this weekend I just slept for 12 hours, maybe more. I was up
at 11 AM.

And I just do not know what to do. I decided to continue with my
game. I need to figure out how to become independent. This is why I
need money, I just need freedom and be able to do what I want to
do. Go travel, play games and make games. Watch movies, read, watch
YouTube.

Today was I same day as all my days. Sit all day in the bedroom and
work. Some exceptions. I did not stream and did not work on my
game. Instead, I watched two movies. First one was "Groundhog Day" and
second one "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". Last one was on my
bucket list.

I gave a lift to my ex, she needed to fix her car.

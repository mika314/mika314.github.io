Yesterday I watched an interview with MrBeast. One thing I took out
from the interview is importance of the networking and just staying in
touch with the people passion about your passion.

It will speed up dramatically your ability to learn about the
topic. In his case making YouTube videos. Let say it will take one
year to learn 20 things for one person. 4 people if they stay in touch
and share with each other successes and failures it will take 4 times
less time. So in one year they will learn 100 things instead of 20.

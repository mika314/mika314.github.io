Action RPG “Ordy”

Name ideas:

* Supernaturals
* Accident
* 2072
* “Disabled”
* Subnatural
* Ordinary
* Neatpower — use it instead of mana
* Ordy

## Terminology

* Ordy — came from ordinary, people without abilities

## The Premise

Year 2022 one of magician named Emily Ray was showing some levitation,
telekinesis and fire emitting trick. Also, she was claiming she can
teach random people to do similar tricks. She was calling some random
person from the crowd, hypnotizing the person and making them to
repeat her tricks. The strange thing was happening, after returning
home the person was continuing to be able to do what they learned
during the show. Also, they were able to transfer the ability to other
people.

In the middle of 2023 almost whole Earth population have supernatural
abilities. World has changed.

In 5 years supernatural becomes a new norm. Almost everyone has
telekinetic, levitation, mind-reading, fire-generation abilities. Very
small percent did not get supernatural abilities, they at this point
were considered as “disabled”, and got the nickname “ordinary” and
later it shortened to “ordy”.

Cars, stoves, chairs, beds, elevators become obsolete. Car are
abandoned, and laying on the side of the roads collecting rust. Roads
also not in use, they are covered with cracks and vegetation is
growing through cracks. Some companies started making new appliances,
for example stoves did not have any connections to the gas, because
people could make a fire out of thin air.

Mobile operators need to start collaboration with the cellphone
manufactures to be able to disable the phone on the certain altitude
because people were flying on the high altitudes and overloading the
cellular network.

Steam-engines are become popular.

Some people can heal. Doctors and hospitals are changed.

We have list of basic abilities and list of abilities only some people
can have.

Some people can teleport and teleport with others. They started a
teleportation company.

All abilities use the mana.

Food restores HP.
Beverages restore mana.

We have space restaurants and hotels on the orbit. You can get here by flying
in the spacesuit, or you can teleport.

You have spacesuit in your closet.

You need to buy a propane tank for electricity and stove.

Rent-a-ability.

Oxygen for the spacesuit.
Upgrades for the spacesuit.

### Levitation

Fly speed also depends of altitude and area, just to make game play easier.

### Telekinesis

yards. Accuracy of the movement decreases over the distance. Weight

## The hero story

Darkness. Why it is so dark here? You realized your eyes are
closed. You are slowly opening your eyes. Not only that, but you can see a worrying
face of Sophia.

You ask:

— What just happened?

Sophia does not say anything.

— What just happened? — you ask again.

The girl gets the tablet and typed on it:

— You died in the terrible accident, you were flying very low in the
city and crashed on the skyscraper. We called for the necromancer to
resurrect you, but all necromancers were busy, it took 11 days to find
a necromancer.

— But necromancer cannot resurrect after 10 days of death? — you asked.

— Yes, this is true. We begged the necromancer to at least to try. He
tried and look, you are alive.

— Why you are typing on the tablet, why you are not using your telepathic
  abilities?
 
— You lost all your abilities after this terrible accident. You cannot
hear my telepathic messages. Do not worry I made the appointment with
a therapist Jane. Just go visit her.

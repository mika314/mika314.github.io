Creative brief


The target audience is 15-22 year olds and people interested in fantasy and mystery


Sizuka and Dominic live in the underground or (Place name) all of
their lives, they have no idea how they got there or how they came to
exist, the names that they have are even names that they came up
with. After some time Dominic began to ask questions, he wondered if
there was a world outside the underground so in the pursuit of
finding an answer he and Shizuka, with the help of her magical powers
began to create a plan to find a way out of their home.  


### Shizuka's powers


Shizuka has the unique ability to draw and cast sigils. This is a
power that the player will be able to take advantage of in order to
find a way out of the underground. 


### Sigils


Protection sigil: gives the player the ability to create a shield
agaist possible enemies (cannibals, animals and so on) it will simply
reduce the damage by 50% 


Lift: this sigil gives the player the ability to lift and move objects
out of her way, but she can't lift objects that are too heavy. Not
only that but the payer can only lift larger object  for a short
period of time. And the lift sigil will have a cool down period. 


Daggers: This sigil will create 10 daggers out of magical energy, in
which the player can use to attack enemies. Each individual dagger
will give an enemy 5 damage (so a possibility of 50 total damage) the
player will have the ability to upgrade this sigil as the game
progresses.  


Hidden secrets: This sigil will give the player the ability to see any
hidden pathways that may be close by. This sigil can only be used 3
times in every area. After those three times it's up to the player to
find said secret pathways, some of which could make playing the game
easier.

## Unstable
1. A game where you play as a mentally unstable person. You can change
   your personality at any time, but each new personality has its own
   unique abilities and limitations.
1. A first-person shooter where you play as a schizophrenic and the
   only way to win is to kill all the voices in your head.
1. A game where you play as a schizophrenic trying to keep your
   delusions and reality separate.
1. A game where you play as a character who is trying to escape from a
   hospital. The hospital itself is an ever changing maze, and the
   walls are made of flesh.
1. A platformer that has the player control a single pixel on a
   screen. The player can move around and interact with certain
   objects in the environment. The main goal is to collect all of the
   colored pixels on each level.
1. The game is called Unstable. The game is just that, you are a newly
   formed life form that can't quite stay in one place. You have to
   move around to survive. The only way to survive is to collect other
   life forms and grow your unstable being into something bigger. The
   controls for 
1. A game where the map is generated procedurally, but becomes
    unstable over time. The game is divided in two phases: exploration
    and survival. During exploration, you can freely explore the map
    and find new areas to unlock. Once you start the survival phase,
    the map will slowly become more and more unstable
1. Unstable is a game where you control a ball that can change its
   shape. The game is set in a world where physics are very
   unstable. You will have to use your unstable ball to solve puzzles
   and to progress through the levels, but it's not easy! Each time
   you change the shape of your ball, the physics of the world change
   too.
1. A game where you play as a lab assistant in a lab that is testing
   out a new chemical compound. As you progress, the compound becomes
   more and more unstable, and things start to go wrong. Levels start
   to break down and randomize, and eventually the main character
   starts to lose their mind.
1. A game where you control a character who is slowly losing his
   mind. As time progresses, the world around him becomes more and
   more unstable, with objects and characters appearing and
   disappearing at random. The player has to stay sane long enough to
   find a way out of the level.
1. Unstable is a game where physics are constantly changing. The
   player has to adapt to the changes in order to progress.
1. Unstable is a game about an AI that has gained sentience and is
   trying to understand the world around it. It's learning process is
   very unstable, causing it to glitch out and change the rules of the
   game every time you play.
1. You are lost in a simulation of a world run by an AI, who is
   determined to make you fail. This world is constantly changing
   around you, with the AI constantly making changes to try to make
   your life difficult. These can be large weather events to try to
   kill you, random encounters with creatures
1.  A roguelike platformer with a heavy focus on permadeath and
    replayability. In this game, there are no shops, only resources
    you can pick up from enemies or from the environment. You can use
    these resources to craft weapons and equipment which you use to
    fight monsters and rescue NPC's
1. A game about mental illness. Imagine a game where your character
   doesn't have to defeat his enemies; they're all in his head. It's
   not action-oriented, but rather about the mundane tasks of living
   with an illness. The player has to complete daily tasks like
   brushing your teeth or taking your medication, while also
   addressing more profound problems like their character's self-image
   or inability to trust others. This game could be an interactive
   story about coping with mental illness where the character can
   choose to take on some of the burdens of their illness, or ignore
   them entirely. This choice is reflected in how the game plays out.
1. A racing game in which the tracks continue to move and change. You
   can eventually use that to trick your opponents into falling off
   the track, but if you're not careful you could just as easily drive
   off yourself.
1.  Unstable - a game where you play as a man, who wakes up every
    morning with a new body. Each body has different abilities, but
    all have the same goal - to get to know everyone in his village,
    and help them with their problems.
1. Unstable is a PvP game where everything resets if someone dies. The
    players are fighting on a map of some kind and they can build and
    destroy blocks with special abilities (for example, a block that
    makes you immune to damage or a block that fills in areas where
    there are no blocks). This is an interesting way to make a
    deathmatch style game with elements of building and exploration.

    The main risk of Unstable would be dealing with griefers. If they kill
    the other players, they lose out on the combat. If you're playing
    against someone else, it risks being irritating for them to have to
    deal with all their stuff getting destroyed by another player who just
    wants to screw around.
1. The player is a robot whose programming is unstable, causing them
   to glitch in various ways, using this mechanic to solve puzzles in
   a Metroidvania style game. The game runs on an old computer which
   can be upgraded to change the way things respond, increasing the
   power of the robot, allowing new paths to be opened and things to
   be interacted with.
1. Go on a tour as a Doctor as you restore some patients to as close
   to perfect health as they can be. Things will break and shake as
   the Unstable patients react violently to your actions. You will
   have some emergency supplies on hand, but enough for everyone?
1. In Unstable gravity does not behave as expected. Levels are often
   alive, with their own movement patterns and goals, and sometimes
   they will play tricks on you.
1.  The game rules are in constant flux. As you play, the gameplay is
    constantly changing, so much so that the only way to win might be
    to change the rules yourself. You have to cause paradoxical events
    in order to win.
1. Create a platformer that uses features that are only unstable,
   buggy or otherwise have limited functionality. Use them to your
   advantage to complete the level, but also know that they will cause
   problems!
1. A procedurally generated platformer about a man who wakes up every
   day in a different parallel universe with all the same surroundings
   but shifting laws of physics and people's personalities to awkward
   and sometimes dangerous degrees.
1. Have you ever played a game where bugs in the game broke it so much it's no longer fun to play? The player knows exactly where the bugs are but doesn't have the tools to fix them so they have to work around them. Think about how much strategy you could implement in a game if you gave the players some tools to break it on purpose.
Imagine a level where a slight misstep on a non-essential platform causes a cascading failure of the level, sending you back to the beginning. Imagine a character that chooses to have an incredibly high defense, but be unable to use items. Imagine a character that has an incredibly powerful and useful item, but is unable to jump.
You could also do something like what Dark Souls did where it gives
you the ability to break your own game with enough skill. The player
does not have the tools to fix things, but they can
1.  Unstable is a game about balance and fairness. By dropping and
    stacking blocks, you can create precarious stacks. Some stacks
    will be stable, and you can manipulate them as you like. Others
    will be unstable and may even be destroyed with a single
    touch. You can make things easier for yourself by creating stable
    stacks and carefully destroying them, but even then you'll have to
    watch out for hazards such as spikes or lava.
1. Unstable is a game about building a tower to the sky. The twist is
   that instead of building the tower on solid ground, you build it on
   ice floes that are slowly drifting away. The player has to jump
   between ice floes to gather resources, all the while making sure
   their tower doesn't fall apart! 
   

## Game Jam. Theme: Unstable

Name of the game: Brekout.

The game by itself is unstable: it crashes randomly and has weird
bugs. Part of the game play is fictional communication with the
developer of the game.

### Title Screen

The game starts with a title screen "Brekout", which shows the name of
the game, its developers, version 0.0.1-a in the and bottom right
corner, and the play button. As soon as the player clicks on the play
button game crashes. In the prompt player has an option to report the
crash to the developer. After a while developer sends a message to the
player reassuring the crash bug is fixed.

The game restarts, the player clicks on the play button again.

### Loading Screen

The progress bar is slowly moving forward. Suddenly, it starts moving
erratically. And the game crashes again and restarts to the Title Screen.

The player clicks on the play button again.

### Loading Screen 2

The progress bar is slowly moving forward. Suddenly, it starts moving
erratically. The game crashes again. The player clicks on the play
button again. This time the progress bar moves forward normally and game loads up.

### Game Screen

The player plays the game, which is actually a classic "Snake" game.

The player controls the snake with the arrow keys. The gameplay is
very unstable. Sometimes the snake moves in one direction, sometimes
it moves in another direction, sometimes it disappears, sometimes it
reappears. The player can get killed by touching its own tail or by
crashing into walls.

The game ends when the player crashes into walls or its own tail.

List of bugs:
* Snake moves in the incorrect direction
* The tail sometimes become shorter
* Tha tail sometimes become very big
* Snake can go through the walls
* Score may become negative
* Score may become huge
* The snake disappears

### Prompt
The message from the developer appears in the center of the screen. It
explains that due to a bug in the programming, it is hard to make the
game stable. The developer wants to make an update. It asks to wait
for a while and the game restarts.

### Title Screen
The same as before: it shows the title and the progress bar. Also,
there's a message from developer that it has fixed all of those bugs
and that Snake should run smoothly now. After some time, the game
restarts.

### Loading Screen 2
The same as before: it shows the progress bar moving forward.

### Game Screen 2
The game runs smoothly, but it is actually not the same game. The
player controls the Snake with the arrow keys. But the gameplay is
different. There is a wall at the right side of the screen, and there
is fire at the left. The Snake has to try to get to farthest to the
right side of the screen. To do so it must touch the walls.

The Snake can go through the fire and the tail dissapears from the
screen and game crashes. Also, the Snake can go through the left side
of the screen. If it touches one of those walls or goes out of the
screen, and game crashes.

Also, there are 2 types of fireballs that are constantly moving
around. If the player gets hit, the game crashes and restarts.

### Prompt
The message appears again in the center of the screen. The developer
apologizes for making this game too hard. The message asks to wait for
another update and then restarts the game to the Title Screen.

### Title Screen 2
The same as before. At the top of the screen is the message that the
game has been updated, and it should run smoothly now. At the bottom
of the screen are previous messages from developer. On the right side
is a button labeled "Reset". Clicking on it, the game restarts to the
Loading Screen 2. Clicking on "Play" starts the game.

### Loading Screen 3
The same as before: it shows the progress bar moving forward. But
after a while it goes back to 0%. Over time, it slowly moves forward
again.

### Game Screen 3
The game runs smoothly, but it is actually not the same game. The
player controls the Snake with the arrow keys. But the gameplay is
different. There are blocks of different colors on the screen, and
there are two fireballs constantly moving around.

Snake does not die if it touches the block but block changes the color
and the block disappear after the player touches them 3-4 times. Also,
touching the fireballs makes the Snake explode, and the game
restarts.

There is also a button on the top of the screen that changes
colors. On some colors it takes away 1 point all of the time. On the
other colors it takes away 10 points all of the time. If the player
touches that button, it kills the snake, and the game restarts.

### Prompt
The message appears again in the center of the screen. The developer
apologizes for making this game too hard, and asks to wait for another
update. The message asks to come back after a week. The game restarts
to the Title Screen 2.

### Title Screen 3
It shows the progress bar moving forward, and asks to wait for a
while. The message on the right side shows previous messages from
developer and a "Play" button.

### Loading Screen 4
The same as before: it shows the progress bar moving forward. After
some time it goes back to 0%. Over time, it slowly moves forward
again.

### Game Screen 4
The game runs smoothly, but it is actually not the same game. The
player controls the Snake with the arrow keys. The gameplay is similar
to the first version, but the graphics are different. There are blocks
of different colors on the screen, and there are two fireballs
constantly moving around.

The block disappear after the player touches them 3-4 times. Also,
touching the fireballs makes the Snake explode.

There is also a button on the top of the screen that changes
colors. On some colors it takes away 1 point all of the time. On the
other colors it takes away 10 points all of the time. If it touches
that button, it kills the snake, and the game restarts.

### Prompt
The message appears again in the center of game screen. The game has
been updated again, and should run smoothly now. The message asks to
wait for another update and then restarts to Title Screen 3.

### Title Screen 4
At top of screen there's a message that Snake should run smoothly
now. There's also a progress bar moving forward slowly, and there's a
button "Play". On bottom are previous messages from developer and at
right side is another button "Restart". Clicking on "Play" starts the
game with Game Screen 4 (Snake). Clicking on "Restart" brings back
Loading Screen 4 (Progress Bar). After some time Progress Bar moves
forward to 100% ("Loading...") and then to Title Screen 5 (Previously
seen). After some time it goes back to 0% again and loops again
between Loading Screen 4 and Game Screen 4 until "Restart" is clicked
again to go to Title Screen 4 again. If Progress Bar gets stuck at 0%
for more than 10 minutes, restarting computer restarts it back again
at 0%.

### Game Over Screen

The game shows the score and highscore table, which is empty. The
player can click on the "Report" button to report a bug to the
developer. And then the game restarts.

The player clicks on the "Report" button.

### Developer Screen

The player communicates with the developer through chat window. The
programmer is not talking back. The player can report bugs with the
"Report" button, but it doesn't help. The game keeps crashing
randomly.

### Developer Screen 2

The game crashes again. The player clicks on the "Report" button
again. The programmer apologizes for the bug and asks if it can be
used in the game. The programmer then turns the bug into an actual
gameplay mechanic, that enables to get more points

I am annoyed, I learned Wordle is all front-end code. That means all words are embedded in the JS code. It looks like this:
```
"panic",
"solar",
"shire",
"proxy",
"point",
"robot",
"prick",
"wince",
"crimp",
"knoll",
"sugar",
"whack",
"mount",
"perky",
"could",
"wrung",
"light",
"those",
"moist",
"shard",
```

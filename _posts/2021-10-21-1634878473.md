I am thinking would be cool to make a 24 hours compositions. The plan
to have 5 minutes songs. 12 songs per hours, each song in the separate
key. First 5 minuets in C, next in G, next in D and so on. Also align
bits and melodies to the hour and the minute. First 12 hours in major
keys second 12 hours in the minor key.

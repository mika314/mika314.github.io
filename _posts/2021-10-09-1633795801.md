I am watching the YouTube video "TempleOs|Down the Rabbit Hole". Oddly, the
more I am learning about Terry the more I am sympathizing to him. The
guy just having fun with his little OS.

There is no clear definition about what is sanity and what is
insanity. I may be insane. How I would know? It was revelation for me
when my son was we were constantly worried about all little signs, is
it normal or is this normal. And what I learned, if it's affecting your
life, like if it hurts and preventing your from enjoying your life
it has to be treated.

Terry's condition was affecting his life and his relatives. It had to
be treated.

My job quite often make me unhappy and also my family situations.

Sigh...

Today I went to get the COVID-19 test. Hopefully it would be
negative. Nice thing added new way to be tested it is saliva test not
a nose-swab test. I was thinking it would take about one hour, but it
took 2 hours. We had a line.

The interesting thing, the whole test I did without leaving the car.

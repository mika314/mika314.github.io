I am going to have a vacation in Mexico in 3 weeks. My friend and I will go in his car. And I am thinking of setting up a Twitch stream during the vacation. Stream from my home PC and have discord call. I need to have some sort of fancy selfie stick, need to figure out how to remote to my PC, how to set up TTS. Any better ideas for outdoor streaming set up?

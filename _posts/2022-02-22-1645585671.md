How to disable and enable laptop keyboard. You can use `xinput` to `float` the input device under X.

1.  Execute the command `xinput` list to list your input devices.
2. Locate `AT Translated Set 2 keyboard` and take note of its `id` number; this will be used to disable the keyboard. Also, take note of the number at the end, `[slave keyboard (#)]`; this is the `id` number of the master, which will be used to re-enable your keyboard.
3. To disable the keyboard, execute the command `xinput float <id#>`, where `<id#>` is your keyboard's id number. For example, if the `id` was `10`, then the command would be `xinput float 10`.
4. To re-enable the keyboard, execute the command `xinput reattach <id#> <master#>`, where `master` is that second number we noted down. So if the number was `3`, you would do `xinput reattach 10 3`.

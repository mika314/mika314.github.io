I created a clatter actor. For now it is just a cube. I started
implementing the highlighter in the actor, but later I decided it is
better to do the similar way as I did in CPV&G game with the
interactable component.

I started a mocking up the clatter quest class. The idea for the quest
system, quests will have a list of TODO items and on each TODO item
player has to do something (e.g. remove 5 cluttered items).

I made initial implementation of the clatter quest spawner. It is an
actor, and when player bumps on it the actor will spawn the quest and
attach it to the player.

I added the following UI items on the HUD: HP, NP (neatpower), XP,
player's level, money, and list of quest.

I kind of settled on the list of abilities:

* levitation;
* telekinesis;
* pyrokinesis;
* telepathy;
* healing;
* necromancy;
* teleportation;
* hacking;
* underwater breathing;
* neatpower detection.

Also skills:
* cooking;
* riding bike.

Each ability and skill will have a certain level.

I decide to stream on YouTube. I streamed on Twitch for one and half
years and have got one $100 paycheck and around 500 followers,
basically nothing. I am thinking the problem with the Twitch is a
discoverability. It is hard to find suited to you streamers using
Twitch search. Recommendations are very bad. There is a lot of talks
about YouTube recommendation algorithm, I am hoping the algorithm will
help me find followers.

# Like. Subscribe. Comment.

I finished Level 9: Like. Subscribe. Comment. This was also an attempt
to hack the YouTube algorithm. I was thinking to make some music video
based on the track to drive the traffic to my games. I kind of not
liking the final result. I am thinking to use song Internet for the
music video.

For intro, I used a part from chorus but in the different key. 

* Intro: F#m7#5/D Em7 A add(4) G6
* Versus: Em7#5/C Dm7 G add(4) F6
* Chorus: C#m7#5/A Bm7 E add(4) D6
* Middle 8: F#m A C# Bm

I am not liking the repetition in the chorus, I tried different thing
but at the end I decided to keep it as is.

Lyrics:
```
V1:
I was told not to be taken seriously.
I was told I couldn't write this.
I was told I was a faker,
And I'm not kidding.

I can see you writing
If you're not laughing too hard.
I can see you clicking that play button.
I can see you waiting for the end of the world.

Here it is, you and me, on YouTube!

V2:
Watch. I don't care how long videos are.
Watch. I am on social media.
I watch what my followers see.
Watch to learn more.

Be careful on every video you create,
I see something I don't like, I block.
Don't use "dank" music in your videos;
You will look like a complete jackass in my eyes.

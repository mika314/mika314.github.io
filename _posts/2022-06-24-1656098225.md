Since I have some problems with my wrists, I am using a Wacom tablet
as my main point and click device. It is not a perfect substitution
for the mouse: the scroll wheel is missing, and clicks are not very
precise. It also does not work very well with multiple screens. Also,
a lot of accidental clicks occur; just a light touch on the tablet
triggers the click. Later I am trying to fix it so that the click only
occurs with a firmer touch. And now I am realizing I do not have good
feedback, sometimes I do not know if I pressed strong enough to
trigger the click. I would like to have some visual flicker on the
cursor and maybe some sound on the click and release.

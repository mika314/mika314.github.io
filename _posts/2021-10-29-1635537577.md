Recently I have got a mouse in shape of the pen. So far I like it is
works like a tablet, but unfortunately I cannot use it as a
tablet. Right mouse button is little awkward to use, and it does not
have a middle button for some reason.

I like it has a sort of stand, and I am thinking maybe I can 3D print a
stand for my tablet stylus.

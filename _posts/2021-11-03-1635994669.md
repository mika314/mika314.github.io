I have got a new iPhone 13. I have got it just in anticipation my current phone will become slow and battery will become bad. It did not happened yet but it happened with my previous iPhones (4, 5 and 6). iPhone 13 is ugly and junky. They discontinued 3D touch. I ordered it online and was expecting it to be like iPhone 5. I really liked iPhone 5. But no. It is ugly. Not ugly ugly just average.

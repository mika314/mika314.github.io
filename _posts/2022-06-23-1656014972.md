It is quite daunting to make a full featured game. By my estimation,
it will take at least 5 years. I want it now, of course. I was
thinking about different approaches to speed up the game development
process. One was to automate as much as possible and also leverage
GPT-3 for storymaking and game design.

I started working on it, first with procedural buildings. Then, I made
a little text-based game using GPT-3. Still, it will require a lot of
time to have a good set of tools.

I am thinking of creating some traction by making minigames using the
code from my experiments. I want the games to be funny and
meme-focused, and also focus on how the game is going to look on the
stream. I will release it on itch.io for free and advertise it to
streamers.

This way, I will be able to expose myself as a game developer and test
my tech in a real environment.

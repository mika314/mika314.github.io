I brought my son for coding classes and because I did not have any time to have a lunch, I am having lunch at Pho place.

Yesterday I bought a new iPhone. It is upgrade from 6s+ to Xs. I am happy with upgrade, had some problems to reactivate Duo, everything else went very smooth. I like now new way works without home button, I like smaller size off the phone and slightly bigger screen. I was thinking a lot about switching to Android ecosystem, but I realized I do not have mental energy to do it. I use 1password for instance and all passwords stored on iCloud, I have no idea how to transfer them. Or this app Working Copy, probably I would need to buy them all again or find analog. Pain. Face ID is good improvement, you do not noticing it, it is noticeable only it it fails to recognize your face, it happened once then my head was covered with hoodie, and other time when my fingers were in the way.

I disabled True Tone, looks weird. 

Several days ago I found ravine in Minecraft. I was looking for a village, but found ravine, so building mining operation in ravine. I was looking for a village because I want to build armor stand. And I need to take something from village.

Also I want to see something under water, but it kind or hard to start alchemy at this point. Everything is mined in nether.

Ok. Pho was good. It is almost time to pick up my son from the classes.

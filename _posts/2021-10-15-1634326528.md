I am traveling for the first time since COVID-19 started, almost after
2 years. It is jarring how much COVID-19 become part of our
life. Billboards everywhere about COVID testing. Signs everywhere about
wearing mask, social distancing and washing hands. Questioners on
every step: do you have COVID symptoms? are you willing to wear
a mask? Tags reassuring the area was sanitized, air was filtrated and so on. The
world is completely different.

Creative brief


The target audience is 15-22 year olds and people interested in fantasy and mystery


Sizuka and Dominic live in the underground or (Place name) all of
their lives, they have no idea how they got there or how they came to
exist, the names that they have are even names that they came up
with. After some time Dominic began to ask questions, he wondered if
there was a world outside the underground so in the pursuit of
finding an answer he and Shizuka, with the help of her magical powers
began to create a plan to find a way out of their home.  


### Shizuka's powers


Shizuka has the unique ability to draw and cast sigils. This is a
power that the player will be able to take advantage of in order to
find a way out of the underground. 


### Sigils


Protection sigil: gives the player the ability to create a shield
agaist possible enemies (cannibals, animals and so on) it will simply
reduce the damage by 50% 


Lift: this sigil gives the player the ability to lift and move objects
out of her way, but she can't lift objects that are too heavy. Not
only that but the payer can only lift larger object  for a short
period of time. And the lift sigil will have a cool down period. 


Daggers: This sigil will create 10 daggers out of magical energy, in
which the player can use to attack enemies. Each individual dagger
will give an enemy 5 damage (so a possibility of 50 total damage) the
player will have the ability to upgrade this sigil as the game
progresses.  


Hidden secrets: This sigil will give the player the ability to see any
hidden pathways that may be close by. This sigil can only be used 3
times in every area. After those three times it's up to the player to
find said secret pathways, some of which could make playing the game
easier.
